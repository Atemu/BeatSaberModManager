# BeatSaberModManager

### What is this?
BeatSaberModManager is yet another mod installer for Beat Saber, heavily inspired by [ModAssistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant). \
It strives to look more visually appealing and support both Windows and Linux, while still being as feature-rich as ModAssistant.

### Features
Since this project is rather young, it is **not** as feature-complete as ModAssistant at the moment. \
Currently, implemented ones include:
- Windows and Linux support
- Dependency resolution
- Installed mod detection
- Mod uninstallation
- OneClickâ„¢ support for [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com) and [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com)

### Usage
1. **Run the game at least once before trying to mod the game!**
2. Now check / uncheck the mods you wish to install or uninstall and press <kbd>Refresh Mods</kbd>.
   Unlike ModAssistant, there is no extra <kbd>Uninstall</kbd> button, installed mods that are unchecked will automatically be uninstalled.
3. Mods are installed to `IPA/Pending` until the game is run. Boot the game to complete mod installation.

### Roadmap
- Localisation
- Theming support
