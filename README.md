### Usage
1. **Run the game at least once before trying to mod the game!**
2. Now check / uncheck the mods you wish to install or uninstall and press <kbd>Refresh Mods</kbd>.
   Unlike ModAssistant, there is no extra <kbd>Uninstall</kbd> button, installed mods that are unchecked will automatically be uninstalled.
3. Mods are installed to `IPA/Pending` until the game is run. Boot the game to complete mod installation.
